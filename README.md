*my DS project for DS class with DR.Ebrahim moghaddam in fall 98*
project is : VIM editor(!) explicity written in java or CPP

the rules are :
1. no using any library (import or include)
2. just with cpp or java
3. more info in TODO.pdf
 
### TODO
+ update iterator as you go (for insert with iterator)
+ delete

+ SEARCH! trie tree -> stack overflow
+ search : trie tree dorost 
+ search: convert char to line (index ha)

+ w : kalame badi
+ b : kalame ghabli 


### bugs
+ press enter in last line in command mode 
+ long lines problem 
+ no file to save -> dialog box

# how to run: 
+ you can simply run : `make` 
	be careful, this command will open the Vim.java fro msrc folder to edit! 
+ if you have ant, you can run `ant` and then `java -jar Vim.jar`
	or `java -jar Vim.jar filename.txt'`
